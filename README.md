Convert AI Skills (following Claude Skills format) into MCP server resources, making them accessible through the Model Context Protocol.

> **Part of [BioContextAI](https://biocontext.ai)** - A community-driven initiative connecting agentic AI with biomedical resources through standardized MCP servers. While this package is domain-agnostic and can be used for any skill collection, it was developed to support the biomedical research community.

## Overview

This MCP server exposes Claude Skills as resources that can be accessed by LLM applications through the Model Context Protocol. Skills are self-contained directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter, along with supporting files like scripts, references, and examples.

### Features

- **Automatic skill discovery**: Recursively finds all `SKILL.md` files in the `skills/` directory
- **Frontmatter parsing**: Extracts skill metadata (name, description) from YAML frontmatter
- **Three core tools**:
  - `get_available_skills`: Lists all available skills with descriptions
  - `get_skill_details`: Returns SKILL.md content and file listing for a specific skill
  - `get_skill_related_file`: Reads any file within a skill directory (with directory traversal protection)
- **Security**: Path validation prevents access outside skill directories

## Getting Started

## Configuration

The MCP server requires a skills directory to be specified. This allows you to:
- Install the package separately from your skills
- Edit skills without modifying the package
- Use different skill collections for different projects

Set the skills directory using either:
- Command-line option: `--skills-dir /path/to/skills`
- Environment variable: `SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/skills`

### Example Configuration for MCP Clients

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skill-to-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["skill_to_mcp", "--skills-dir", "/path/to/your/skills"],
      "env": {
        "UV_PYTHON": "3.12"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or using environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skill-to-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["skill_to_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "UV_PYTHON": "3.12",
        "SKILLS_DIR": "/path/to/your/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured in your MCP client, the server provides three tools:

### get_available_skills

Returns a list of all available skills with metadata:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "single-cell-rna-qc",
    "description": "Performs quality control on single-cell RNA-seq data...",
    "path": "/path/to/skills/single-cell-rna-qc"
  }
]
```

### get_skill_details

Returns the full SKILL.md content and list of files for a specific skill:
```json
{
  "skill_content": "---\nname: single-cell-rna-qc\n...",
  "files": ["SKILL.md", "scripts/qc_analysis.py", "references/guidelines.md"]
}
```

### get_skill_related_file

Reads a specific file within a skill directory:
```python
get_skill_related_file(
    skill_name="single-cell-rna-qc",
    relative_path="scripts/qc_analysis.py"
)
```

## Creating Skills

Skills should be placed in your configured skills directory. Each skill must:

1. Have its own subdirectory
2. Contain a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter
3. Follow the frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Content

Instructions and documentation go here...
```

### Skill Naming Requirements

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Maximum 64 characters
- No XML tags or reserved words

See the included example `skills/single-cell-rna-qc/SKILL.md` for a complete reference.

### Example Skills Directory Structure

```
my-skills/
├── skill-1/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── references/
├── skill-2/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── data/
└── skill-3/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.11 or newer installed on your system.
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend installing [uv][].

There are several alternative options to install skill-to-mcp:

1. Use `uvx` to run it immediately (requires SKILLS_DIR environment variable):

```bash
SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/skills uvx skill_to_mcp
```

Or with the command-line option:

```bash
uvx skill_to_mcp --skills-dir /path/to/skills
```

2. Include it in various MCP clients that support the `mcp.json` standard:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skill-to-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["skill_to_mcp", "--skills-dir", "/path/to/your/skills"],
      "env": {
        "UV_PYTHON": "3.12"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Install it through `pip`:

```bash
pip install --user skill_to_mcp
```

4. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/biocontext-ai/skill-to-mcp.git@main
```

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# Using uvx (recommended)
SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/skills uvx skill_to_mcp

# Using pip
pip install skill_to_mcp
skill_to_mcp --skills-dir /path/to/skills
```

### Production Deployment

For production environments with HTTP transport:

```bash
export MCP_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
export SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/skills
export MCP_TRANSPORT=http
export MCP_PORT=8000

skill_to_mcp
```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install skill_to_mcp

COPY skills /app/skills

ENV SKILLS_DIR=/app/skills
ENV MCP_TRANSPORT=http
ENV MCP_PORT=8000

CMD ["skill_to_mcp"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t skill-to-mcp .
docker run -p 8000:8000 skill-to-mcp
```
